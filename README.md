Book Rental Application:Creating a GUI With JFC/Swing

I did this program to fulfill the University CST 338 software design class final project. 
This Java base application creates a GUI for Windows. It contains few functionalities: Login page, Libary with Options of available books, and a page to put user information. 
I used eclipse ide to build this project. Book Rental application view is built using JFrame and swing.
